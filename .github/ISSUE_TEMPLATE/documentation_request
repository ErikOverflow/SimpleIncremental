**Does the documenation already exist?**
Yes/No

**If yes, provide a link to the documentation. What needs to be updated or changed?**
Link or reference to documentation. Description of what is missing, confusing, deprecated, or needs changing.

**If no, what needs to be documented?**
Description of what needs to be documented. Name of the prefab, layer, or file. 
Please note: not everything _needs_ to be documented. The last thing we want is to provide documentation that wastes the reader's time by explaining concepts that can be assumed as understood.
